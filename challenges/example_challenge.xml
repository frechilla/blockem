        There is always 2 players in a blockem challenge:
          + "challenger": Whoever loads the challenge to play it.
          + "opponent": Another player who can own spaces on the board, so they
                        don't belong to the challenger. It can be set up as
                        active (it also puts down pieces) or inactive through
                        the "active" tag (it can be set to "yes" or "no").
                        This extra player can be handled by the computer or
                        another human being when it is set up as active.
                        
        This "active" tag is MANDATORY (set it to "yes" or "no")
