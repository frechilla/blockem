This directory contains a set of .xml. Each one of them defines a specific 
challenge that can be loaded on the application to be played

Format of these XML files is defined in challenge.dtd, in this directory. 
There is also an example challenge in the file "example_challenge.xml" which 
can be used as a starting point to write your own blockem challenges. It 
contains quite a lot of comments that are supposed to explain each one of the
options that define a blockem challenge

have fun!
