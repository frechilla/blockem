This directory contains a set of .xml. Each one of them defines a specific 
challenge that can be loaded on the application to be played

Format of these XML files is defined in blockem_challenge.dtd, in this
directory. There is also an example challenge in the file 
"example_challenge.xml" which can be used as a starting point to write your 
own blockem challenges. It contains quite a lot of comments that are 
supposed to explain each one of the options that define a blockem challenge

If you want to validate your xml you can use the xmllint program included 
with libxml. For example:
    xmllint --valid --noout example_challenge.xml

The --dtdvalid dtd allows validation of the document(s) against a given DTD.
If the DTD is specified inside the .xml file there is no need for this option

have fun!
