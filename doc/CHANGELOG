now: working version
    - Port to windows done. Code compiles in both linux and windows

04/02/2010: Version 0.1.0
    - This is the first release of this project.
    - At the moment it contains a fully functional 1vs1 game based on the 
      board game blokus (http://blokus.com)
    - 1vs1 means man versus computer, where the computer moves are calculated
      by a simple (and improvable) heuristic.
    - It can be compiled and installed using the well-known autotools.
    - There's still a long way to walk on this project. Have a look at the
      document TODO for a small snapshot of it
