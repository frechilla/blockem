: Version 0.2.0
    - An option has been added to show the nucleation points on the board.
      Shared nucleation points are drawn in black colour.
    - App can be set up to play human vs human, human vs computer and 
      computer vs computer games
    - When playing 1vs1 games against the computer, player1 (the one who goes
      first) can be selected to be the computer (previous versions forced the
      human player to go always first)
    - Heuristic for computer players can be selected when a new game is 
      launched
    - Starting coordinate can be edited when a new game is launched
    - Piece edition improved for those pieces with only one possible
      confuration
    - Application is able to cancel a computing operation for a new game
      to start. In previous versions cancelling the current computing operation
      was only enabled when the human user wanted to close the application, new
      games had to wait 'till the worker thread had finished its calculations
    - libglade dependency removed. Gtkbuilder is used instead
    - Executable in windows has reduced its size around 50%. Released zipped
      binary for windows has been also reduced around 30%
    - Fixed possible deadlock that might have occurred when the game was about
      to finish
    - Player handling through Game1v1 interface simplified

24/04/2010: Version 0.1.6
    - Computer's latest piece deployed glows so human user can easily notice
      what was the latest move
    - App kills itself instead of hunging up when unexpected state occurs 
      if cumputing thread is busy
    - Progress bar and moves calculated by worker thread are totally 
      thread-safe now
    - Command line options are properly handled. Blockem can load a game,
      process the next move and print it out in console with no GUI

16/04/2010: Version 0.1.5
    - Minmax has been fixed. It was faulty because pieces weren't being 
      rotated once they were mirrored during the AI calculations.
    - Editing piece drawing area contains 4 buttons, so the user can rotate
      to the left and right and mirror over the X and Y axis.
    - Game1v1 test code fixed
    - Game->New menu restarts the user's stopwatch even if there's no pieces
      on the board

09/04/2010: Version 0.1.4
    - Added stopwatch to measure how long computer and human take to move
    - Computer player doesn't process the next move so hard if it already 
      managed to block completely the human user (it was a bit tedious to wait
      before)
    - Added a bit of randomness to the starting move when the computer player
      starts. What is life without randomness after all?
    - Progress bar in the status bar is fully functional
    - Removed extra command line window when running in the windows platform
    - Board drawing area is now handling its own events. GUI code has been
      improved a lot throughout the last couple of versions

04/04/2010: Version 0.1.3
    - Computer's pieces left are shown on the right side of the board
    - Current score is shown on the status bar at all times
    - Correct version shown on the AboutDialog when help->About is pressed
    - Editing piece area shows a circle sorrounding the selected piece
    - More refactoring done on the GUI code

26/03/2010: Version 0.1.2
    - The ugly buttons that used to represent pieces have been changed by 
      real (and beautiful) pieces.
    - Ghost pieces on the board were kept painted even when the mouse
      pointer had left the board drawing area. That has been fixed.
    - Icon added to the executable file in the windows version. 
    - Part of the gui code has been refactored (there's a lot of work left)

19/03/2010: Version 0.1.1
    - pthread dependecy has been moved to gthread.
    - Port to windows done. Code compiles in both linux and windows.
    - Unhandled menus in GUI are now blurred so the user can't select them.

04/02/2010: Version 0.1.0
    - This is the first release of this project.
    - At the moment it contains a fully functional 1vs1 game based on the 
      board game blokus (http://blokus.com).
    - 1vs1 means man versus computer, where the computer moves are calculated
      by a simple (and a bit foolish) heuristic.
    - It can be compiled and installed using the well-known autotools.
    - There's still a long way to walk on this project. Have a look at the
      document TODO for a small snapshot of it.
