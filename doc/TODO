This document contains quite a lot of ideas that cross over my mind, which are
supposed to be integrated in blockem at some point in the future:

 + Save and load game can be used through command line but they are not 
   available in the GUI. Load game code needs a bit more of checking
   for the format of the file 
 + Lots of calculation time is being wasted now. The decission tree should be
   calculated and kept in memory, and even updated while the human player is
   thinking (normally the human player takes longer than the computer to 
   "think" the next move)
 + It should be possible to generate doxygen. Add it to the makefiles
 + Installer for the windows platform
 + keep history of the moves and offer the user the possibility to go back
   and resume an old game
 + Improve evaluation function through bitwise representations of boards and 
   pieces. There's already some code done but it is too slow
 + Convert std::lists to standard arrays in Piece
 + cachegrind to profile (instead of gprof)
 + complete rules_test
 + WARNINGS compiling (in release mode, this is, without debug flags passed into ./configure)

 + Improve blockem webpage. Add some sort of link for people willing to 
   translate blockem
 + Improve GUI appearance. For example, depth is a very technical parameter,
   far from what a good user interface should look like
 + It would be really nice to the blockem rules translated into the actual 
   blockem game so anybody could have a look without browsing to the website
 + Add a way to mark which challenges are 'completed' by the user
