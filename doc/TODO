This is a sketch of an organized TODO document. There are a couple of very
basic things that need to be done:

 + Options in menu Settings and Preferences should do something. This should 
   be pretty straight-forward
 + Lots of calculation time is being wasted now. The decission tree should be
   calculated and kept in memory, and even updated while the human player is
   thinking (normally the human player takes longer than the computer to 
   "think" the next move)
 + It should be possible to generate doxygen. Add it to the makefiles
 + Installer for the windows platform
 + There's no need to compile the test app with all the gui libraries and flags
   Have a look at configure.ac and src/test/Makefile.am to fix it
 + Images and icons are not shown correctly in windows
 + keep history of the moves and offer the user the possibility to go back
   and resume an old game
 + Add option to play a game which aim is allocating all the pieces on the 
   board, with no opponent
 + Improve evaluation function through bitwise representations of boards and 
   pieces
 + Final game dialog is shown twice sometimes when playing computer against
   computer
 + App cores when starting coords are the same or are touching for player1 
   and player2 (it doesn't matter if whoever has to go it is a human or 
   the computer)
