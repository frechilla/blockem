This document contains quite a lot of ideas that cross over my mind, which are
supposed to be integrated in blockem at some point in the future:

 + Save and load game can be used through command line but they are not 
   available in the GUI. Load game code needs a bit more of checking
   for the format of the file 
 + Lots of calculation time is being wasted now. The decission tree should be
   calculated and kept in memory, and even updated while the human player is
   thinking (normally the human player takes longer than the computer to 
   "think" the next move)
 + It should be possible to generate doxygen. Add it to the makefiles
 + Installer for the windows platform
 + keep history of the moves and offer the user the possibility to go back
   and resume an old game
 + There should be puzzles. give somebody a set situation and get them to put 
   down all their pieces. you know hte way with those puzzle games. the first 
   one is very easy. e.g. give an empty 5x5 board and get them to put down 
   three pieces...
 + Improve evaluation function through bitwise representations of boards and 
   pieces. There's already some code done but it is too slow
 + Add default button to the new/config dialog
 + Convert std::lists to standard arrays in Piece
 + cachegrind to profile (instead of gprof)
 + complete rules_test
 + stopwatches in total allocation game and 1vs1 game are counting even if 
   the widget is showing nothing. It doesn't really affect performance, but
   it's an ugly thing to do
 + support for non-square shaped boards (is it even good?)
 + scripts should store results into scripts/ directory. Should gprof and
   gcov output be uploaded into the svn repository?
