This document contains quite a lot of ideas that cross over my mind, which are
supposed to be integrated in blockem at some point in the future:

 + Save and load game can be used through command line but they are not 
   available in the GUI. Load game code needs a bit more of checking
   for the format of the file 
 + Lots of calculation time is being wasted now. The decission tree should be
   calculated and kept in memory, and even updated while the human player is
   thinking (normally the human player takes longer than the computer to 
   "think" the next move)
 + It should be possible to generate doxygen. Add it to the makefiles
 + Installer for the windows platform
 + There's no need to compile the test app with all the gui libraries and flags
   Have a look at configure.ac and src/test/Makefile.am to fix it
 + Images and icons are not shown correctly in windows
 + keep history of the moves and offer the user the possibility to go back
   and resume an old game
 + Add option to play a game which aim is allocating all the pieces on the 
   board, with no opponent
 + Improve evaluation function through bitwise representations of boards and 
   pieces
 + There should be puzzles. give somebody a set situation and get them to put 
   down all their pieces. you know hte way with those puzzle games. the first 
   one is very easy. e.g. give an empty 5x5 board and get them to put down 
   three pieces...
 + why not making starting coordinate editable at all times (not only when a
   new game is launched)?
 + Fix warning when compiling in windows
 + Checks like #ifdef WIN32 should be changed into something that is set by
   autotools in config.h
