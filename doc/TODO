This is a sketch of an organized TODO document. There are a couple of very
basic things that need to be done:

 + Options in menu Game and View should do something. This shoulod be pretty 
   straight-forward
 + Those ugly buttons that represent pieces should be changed by actual pieces
 + Opponent's (computer's) pieces should be shown at all times (as well as the
   score)
 + Lots of calculation time is being wasted now. The decission tree should be
   calculated and kept in memory, and even updated while the human player is
   thinking (normally the uman player takes longer than the computer to "think"
   the next move)
 + The GUI code is horrible. It really needs a refactoring
 + It should be possible to generate doxygen. Add it to the makefiles
