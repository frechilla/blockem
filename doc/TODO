This is a sketch of an organized TODO document. There are a couple of very
basic things that need to be done:

 + Options in menu Settings and Preferences should do something. This should 
   be pretty straight-forward
 + The latest piece put down by the computer should be noted, for example
   flashing the piece or using another colour
 + Lots of calculation time is being wasted now. The decission tree should be
   calculated and kept in memory, and even updated while the human player is
   thinking (normally the uman player takes longer than the computer to "think"
   the next move)
 + There are some TODOs in the GUI code is improvable. They'll have to be
   solved little by little
 + It should be possible to generate doxygen. Add it to the makefiles
 + Installer for the windows platform
 + There's no need to compile the test app with all the gui libraries and flags
   Have a look at configure.ac and src/test/Makefile.am to fix it   
 + Fix the test app
 + Images and icons are not shown correctly in windows
