This note is meant to explain how to compile this project in windows.

First of all you'll need to install the MinGW environment in your windows
machine. Have a look at: 
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO_Install_the_MinGW_GCC_Compiler_Suite

You'll also need the port of the GTKmm library for windows. Have a look at:
http://live.gnome.org/gtkmm/MSWindows/
at the time version 2.16 was supposed to be the most stable

I installed the following packages in my windows machine to compile blockem
in windows. And it worked!

gtkmm-win32-devel-2.16.0-4.exe (on a different folder than MSYS)

gcc-c++-4.4.0-mingw32-bin.tar.gz
gcc-c++-4.4.0-mingw32-dll.tar.gz

libintl-0.17-2-msys-dll-8.tar.lzma
libgettextpo-0.17-2-msys-dll-0.tar.lzma

Since Gtkmm contains its own version there will be 2 intl libraries (libintl)
in your system. automake detecs one of them and just adds -lintl to the linker
line in the compiling process. Gcc's linker takes the wrong one and as a result
several errors like the following ones are printed on the screen:

main.o:main.cpp:(.text+0x191b): undefined reference to '__printf__'

to prevent this from happening you have to pass a few options to the configure
script to force the app to be compiled against the gettext library included in
the package and to disable pthreads:

./configure --with-included-gettext

At some point compiling with pthreads enabled should be tested, but having it
disabled does the trick for the moment (though at compile time some warnings
are printed on the screen because some parts of libintl are disabled)
