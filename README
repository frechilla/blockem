Blockem package
===============

This is a package that contains the latest version of the game Blockem.
Blockem is a strategy board game based on the well-known game blokus (R)

Currently it only supports 1vs1 mode to be played against the computer (which
has a bit of AI). It's still a very early release but it's a fully functional
package (with a lot of improvement to be done)

This is the URL of the project, where you should be able to find much more than
what is written in this README:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/blockem

Any query, please contact frechilla@gmail.com. I'll be glad to help.


Documentation
-------------

There's not much documentation about this project yet, but there should be more
information online than there is in this README file. You should find the most 
updated version of the source code along with some documentation and help in 
there.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Blockem has been developed using OS independent C++ and GTKmm (the C++ version
of GTK+) to build the GUI. It *should* compile in every platform where GTKmm
has been ported, but it has only been tested in linux so far. You'll need the
following libraries to be able to compile this package:
 * gtkmm-2.4
 * glademm-2.4
 
In a Debian based system try to install the following packages. It has been 
tested in ubuntu 9.10:
 * libgtkmm-2.4-dev
 * libglademm-2.4-dev
 
Once those libraries are present in your system untar the package, cd into it,
and run the famous ./configure && make. Once the compiling process is done
you'll see a binary called 'blockem' in the directory src/. That is the 
program you were looking for.
 
At the moment the program expects the pixmaps in a directory called ./pixmaps
(. is the directory where blockem is being run). So if you didn't change 
anything after the `configure && make` process was finished try to run the
program like this: 

$ ./src/blockem

The images should be loaded correctly. If it doesn't happen, do not worry (and
be happy), everything else will work as expected, but the app will be a bit
less pretty.


Developers
----------
 
I haven't had enough time to build the doxygen documentation for the project,
but I tried to document a lot in code using the doxygen standard. There will
be (at some point) a small introduction to the project, including some class 
diagrams to explain the system easily for whoever wants to participate (or
whoever is curious enough to know what is going on in this project)
