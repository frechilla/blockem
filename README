Blockem package
===============

This is a package that contains the latest version of the game Blockem.
Blockem is a strategy board game based on the well-known game blokus (R)

It supports 1vs1 mode which can be player between 2 human beings, and also
against the computer, which has an AI engine based on the minimax algorithm.
The app allows the user to pick amongst several types of heuristic (evaluation
function used in the minimax algorithm). Aditionally it also supports games
where the 2 players are set up to be managed by the minimax engine using
differet (or the same) evaluation function. A developer can easily create a
new evaluation function, add it into the GUI and test it against an existing
heuristic. A "random" evaluation function has been added for this matter

This is the URL of the project, where you should be able to find much more than
what it is written in this README:

http://blockem.sourceforge.net

Any query, please contact frechilla -at- gmail.com. I'll be glad to help.


Documentation
-------------

There's not much documentation about this project yet, but there should be more
information online than there is in this README file. You should find the most 
updated version of the source code along with some documentation and help in 
there.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Blockem has been developed using OS independent C++ and GTKmm (the C++ version
of GTK+) to build the GUI. It *should* compile in every platform where GTKmm
has been ported, but it has only been tested in linux and windows so far.
You'll need the gtkmm-2.4 library, with a version bigger or equal to 2.16
to compile this package. For versions older than 0.2.0 you'll also need
glademm-2.4, but I would recommend to use the latest available version 
 
In a Debian based system try to install 'libgtkmm-2.4-dev'. (It has been 
tested in ubuntu 9.10). Again, if you are trying to compile a version
older than 0.2.0 you'll also need to install 'libglademm-2.4-dev'
 
Once that library is present in your system, untar the package, cd into it,
and run the famous ./configure && make. && make install.
Once the compiling process is done you'll be able to run a binary called 
'blockem' which should be installed in the default binary directory (normally
something like /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin). The installation process also
creates a data directory in a default location (normally /usr/local/share or
/usr/share) where the pixmaps and other program resources are stored.
 
To run the app just open up a terminal and run:
$ blockem

The images should be loaded correctly. If it doesn't happen, do not worry (and
be happy), everything else will work as expected, but the app will be a bit
less pretty.

As I said the package has been ported to windows too. To compile it in that 
platform have a look at the document HOWTO_WINDOWS in the doc/ directory


Developers
----------
 
I haven't had enough time to build the doxygen documentation for the project,
but I tried to document as much as possible in code using the doxygen standard
There will be (at some point) a small introduction to the project, including
some class diagrams to explain the system easily for whoever wants to 
participate (or whoever is curious enough to know what is going on in this 
project)
