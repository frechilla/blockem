Blockem package
===============

This is a package that contains the latest version of the game Blockem.
Blockem is a strategy board game based on the well-known game blokus (R)

Currently it only supports 1vs1 mode to be played against the computer (which
has a bit of AI). It's still a very early release but it's a fully functional
package (with a lot of improvement to be done)

This is the URL of the project, where you'll be able to find much more than
what is written in this README:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/blockem

Any query, please contact frechilla@gmail.com. I'll be glad to help.


Documentation
-------------

There's not much documentation about this project yet, but there should be more
information online than there is in this README file. You should find the most 
updated version of the source code along with some documentation and help.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Blockem has been developed using OS independent C++ and GTKmm (the C++ version
of GTK+) to build the GUI. It *should* compile in every platform where GTKmm
has been ported, but it has only been tested in linux so far. You'll need the
following libraries to be able to compile this package:
 * gtkmm-2.4
 * glademm-2.4
 
 In a Debian based system (i.e. ubuntu) Try to install the following packages:
  * libgtkmm-2.4-dev
  * libglademm-2.4-dev
 
 Once those libraries are present in your system untar the package, cd into it,
 and run from the root of the package 'make'. After the compiling process is
 finished you'll see a binary called 'blockem' which contains the program.
 
 At the moment the program expects the pixmaps in a directory called ./pixmaps
 where . is the directory where blockem is being run. The images won't be 
 loaded correctly if the directory pixmaps is not found. Everything else will
 work as expected
 
 
 Developers
 ----------
 
 I haven't had enough time to build the doxygen documentation for the project,
 but I tried to document a lot in code using the doxygen standard. There will
 be (at some point) a small introduction to the project, including some class 
 diagrams to explain the system easily for whoever wants to participate (or
 whoever is curious enough to know what is going on in this project)
